## Building and running

This project uses Astral's uv as a package and project manager. uv manages project dependencies through he pyproject.toml file.

A Python script is a file intended for standalone execution, e.g., with python <script>.py. Using uv to execute scripts ensures that script dependencies are managed without manually managing environments.
In this project we run scripts as:

```bash
uv run [FILE]
```
